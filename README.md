# Exploring-Inland-Water-Scene-Generation-for-Change-Detection-Analysis


## Abstract

Change detection is becoming indispensable for unmanned aerial vehicles, especially in 
the domain of water landing, rescue and search. However, even the most advanced change detectors 
require large amounts of data for model training and testing. Therefore, a sufficient variety of 
labeled images with different imaging conditions are needed. In this paper, we present a cloning 
method to simulate water-scene and collect labeled multi-challenge sequences automatically. The multi-challenge sequences consist of six challenges to test the effects of dynamic background, weather, and noise on change detection models. Then, we propose an image-translation framework that translates simulated images to synthetic images. This framework uses shared parameters (encoder and generator) and 10 × 10 receptive fields (discriminator), so it can generate realistic synthetic images as model training sets. The experimental results indicate that: 1) different imaging challenges will affect the performance of change detection models; 2) compared with simulated images, the synthetic images can effectively improve the accuracy of (supervised) change detection models.

## Description
Considering that change detection models have to deal with some challenges of water scenes, we generate various simulated multi-challenge sequences, 
including Basic, Dynamic Background, Illumination Variations, Bad Weather, Video Noise, and More Moving Objects. Note:
Each specific sequence is also affected by other challenges, but one challenge is dominant.
Besides, we propose an image-translation framework that translates simulated images to realistic synthetic images.
